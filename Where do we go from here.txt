Major changes needed : 	c-x and c-z binary controlled gate functionality -> Do not believe this is native in pyzx, may be wrong, but this may need new gate classes to be created
			Ry gate functionality
			Are the PREP and MEASURE commands of importance -> If so how to implement
			Aliasing -> Many cqasm files do NOT represent their qubits numerically but with aliasing, how to parse this?


Minor changes needed :	Fixes needed in multiple places where we are passing 1 integer lists
			Need to raise proper type errors if there is a failure
			Is it necessary to hold on to the ".initialize" representation over the circuity in cqasm?
